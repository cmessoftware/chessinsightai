# ChessTrainer – Chess Position Embeddings

## Objective

Extend ChessTrainer to represent chess positions using embeddings in order to:

- detect similar positions
- retrieve similar mistakes
- generate training exercises
- recommend positions to study

This feature enables semantic search over chess positions.

---

# Concept

Embeddings are vector representations of data.

Instead of representing text, we represent **chess positions**.

Example:

FEN position

→ vector representation

Vectors allow similarity search.

Similar positions produce vectors that are close in vector space.

---

# Use Cases

## 1 Find similar mistakes

Example:

User blunders a knight fork.

System retrieves positions with similar tactical patterns.

Output:

- example positions
- explanation
- training exercises

---

## 2 Tactical pattern search

Search positions similar to:

- forks
- pins
- mating attacks
- discovered attacks

---

## 3 Training dataset generation

Positions where the player failed can be clustered.

Clusters correspond to tactical themes.

Example clusters:

fork patterns  
king safety problems  
back rank issues  

---

# Data Source

Positions are extracted from analyzed games.

For each critical moment:

store:

FEN  
evaluation  
tactical_tags  
error_label  

Example:

fen
error_label
tactical_tags
score_diff


---

# Embedding Strategies

There are several ways to represent positions.

---

# Strategy 1 Feature-based embedding

Use existing ML features.

Example features:

material balance  
king safety metrics  
piece activity  
pawn structure  

These features already exist in ChessTrainer.

Vector example:

[0.45, 0.12, -0.32, ...]


Advantages:

- simple
- fast
- explainable

---

# Strategy 2 Board encoding

Encode board as numerical grid.

Example:

64 squares

Each square encoded as piece type.

Example vector size:

64 × piece representation.

---

# Strategy 3 Neural embedding model

Use a neural network trained on positions.

Input:

FEN

Output:

vector embedding.

This approach requires training.

---

# Recommended Approach

Start with **feature-based embeddings**.

Reasons:

- features already exist
- no training required
- interpretable

Later upgrade to neural embeddings.

---

# Vector Database

Positions can be stored in a vector database.

Recommended options:

Chroma  
Qdrant  

Example record:

embedding
fen
error_label
tactical_tags
game_id


---

# Retrieval Pipeline

When a new game is analyzed:

1 detect critical position
2 generate embedding
3 query vector database
4 retrieve similar positions

Example query:

find similar positions
where tactical_tags includes "fork"


---

# Training Exercise Generation

If a user fails a tactic:

System retrieves positions with similar embeddings.

Example output:

Training recommendation:

fork tactic exercises

Example positions:

position1  
position2  
position3  

---

# Integration with AI Coach

The AI coach can include examples.

Example feedback:

"You missed a knight fork on move 24.  
Here are similar positions where this pattern appears."

---

# UI Integration

Add section:

Similar Positions

Display:

board position  
tactic type  
explanation  

---

# Future Improvements

Possible upgrades:

- train neural position embeddings
- combine board embeddings with text embeddings
- build tactical recommendation engine
