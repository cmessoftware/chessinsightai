# AI Chess Coach - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the active technical documentation for the **ChessInsightAI** AI Chess Coach project.

The architecture baseline is **Core + Extensions**:

- `ai_chess_coach` is the product and technical core.
- UI, API/FastAPI, observability, deployment, and research are extension/satellite modules around the core.
- The analysis engine (ML + AI + chess evidence orchestration) is a standalone module that can be consumed by any presentation channel.

## Documentation Structure

- [`architecture/`](architecture/) — high-level architecture, dependency maps, and migration guidance
- [`modules/`](modules/) — module taxonomy, labels, aliases, and implementation-domain references
- [`roadmap/`](roadmap/) — phased delivery planning and future work sequencing
- [`testing/`](testing/) — testing strategy and release quality gates
- [`devops/`](devops/) — delivery, deployment, rollback, and operational constraints
- [`observability/`](observability/) — metrics, logging, alerting, and traceability strategy
- [`research/`](research/) — research boundaries and experiment-to-production promotion rules

## OpenSpec Workflow

OpenSpec is managed from this directory (`docs/ai_chess_coach`).

Operational command convention:

```powershell
mamba run -n chess_trainer npx -y @fission-ai/openspec <command>
```

Examples:

```powershell
mamba run -n chess_trainer npx -y @fission-ai/openspec list
mamba run -n chess_trainer npx -y @fission-ai/openspec validate gestionar-specs-ai-chess-coach
mamba run -n chess_trainer npx -y @fission-ai/openspec show migrate-pgn-feature-specs --type change --no-interactive
```

Definition of Done for requirement changes:

- Every requirement change MUST be created as an OpenSpec change.
- Every change MUST include `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `specs/`, and `tasks.md`.
- `openspec validate <change-name>` MUST pass before implementation starts.
- No implementation should start without an active OpenSpec change.

## Core Architecture Principles

- **LLM never decides.**
- **LLM only explains grounded evidence.**
- Stockfish, ML, RAG, and validation rules are evidence sources with distinct responsibilities.
- Higher-level layers must not bypass orchestration safeguards.
- Research artifacts must remain isolated from production implementation documentation.

## Logical Flow

```text
PGN -> Core Analysis Engine -> Evidence Fusion -> Analysis Contract -> Extension Adapter (API/UI/Batch)
```

## Implementation Domains

```text
core-analysis
core-orchestration
core-contracts
ext-api-fastapi
ext-ui
ext-observability
ext-devops
ext-testing
ext-research
```

## Governance Rules

- Every module must map to roadmap phases and issue labels.
- Each submodule must have one technical owner and one backup owner.
- Every issue must include domain, type, priority, and status labels.
- Issues should also include alias, domain, phase, and owner where applicable.
- No phase is complete until testing, observability, and rollback criteria are satisfied.

## Migration Status

The documentation structure replaces older references under legacy paths.

**Course folder:** `docs/ai_chess_coach_course/` is **suspended** (frozen reference). Active planning lives under `docs/ai_chess_coach/roadmap/`.

For migration details, see:
- [`architecture/02-document-migration-plan.md`](architecture/02-document-migration-plan.md)

## Notes

- Legacy material under `obsoletes-specs` should be treated as reference-only.
- Active documentation should link only to the new structure under `docs/ai_chess_coach/`.
- New documents should include roadmap, testing, and rollback sections where applicable.
